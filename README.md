## Overview

![screenshot](design/desktop-screenshot.jpg)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- You can check out the demo here:[Demo](http://interior-designn.netlify.app/)

- This was a very interesting project. I struggled for quite a bit before I got a lot of things to work and I'd say it contributed positively to the experience.

- I've learned to not easily give up and nothing is impossible if I put my mind to it.

- Wisdom - I know what it is to give up, now I wanna see what happens when I don;t.
